I would say I was stock, issues with connecting an API which sends an OTP to a number in my server which while trying returns an error. I was a group work so it reduced our speed, a group of users where affected. 
The root cause was due to lack of knowledge of how to use the API.

The issue was detected during testing process.
The issue was detected due to failure to complete testing.
No part was Investigated because we knew where the problem came from.
There were several ideas to come about the solution to the problems, which were not helpful.
It was a group project so obviously it came from my team.
Through research and brainstorming.

We were given a result platform to handle which we made use of an API, we had issues in connecting an API which sends an OTP to a number in my server which while running, returns an error. I was a group work so it reduced our speed, a group of users where affected. 
We fixed it by working together as a team during brainstorming session and also researches to come to reason why we were getting such errors. We made use of a different API which worked out for us.

I think one of the things can be improved is creating a downloadable API for such format, to easily avoid errors.
Make sure to use an automatic debugging system, keep things simple
 Thank youâ€¦
